  :comments: "Whatever you experience in your life—pain, pleasure, heat,
   cold or anything else—is like something happening in a dream.
   Although you might think things are very solid, they are like passing memory.
    You can experience this open, unfixated quality in sitting meditation;
    all that arises in your mind—hate love and all the rest—is not solid.
    Although the experience can get extremely vivid,
    it is just a product of your mind. Nothing solid is really happening."
