There are six teachings that you might misinterpret: patience, yearning, excitement, compassion, priorities and joy. The misinterpretations are:

    1. You’re patient when it means you’ll get your way but not when your practice brings up challenges.

    2. You yearn for worldly things but not for an open heart and mind.

    3. You get excited about wealth and entertainment but not about your potential for enlightenment.

    4. You have compassion for those you like and admire but not for those you don’t.

    5. Worldly gain is your priority rather than cultivating loving-kindness and compassion.

    6. You feel joy when your enemies suffer, but you do not rejoice in others’ good fortune.
