    :comments: "The preliminaries are also known as the four reminders.
      In your daily life, try to:

      1. Maintain an awareness of the preciousness of human life.
      2. Be aware of the reality that life ends; death comes for everyone.
      3. Recall that whatever you do, whether virtuous or not, has a result;
         what goes around comes around.
      4. Contemplate that as long as you are too focused on self-importance and
         too caught up in thinking about how you are good or bad,
         you will suffer. Obsessing about getting what you want
         and avoiding what you donâ€™t want does not result in happiness."
